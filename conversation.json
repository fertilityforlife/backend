        "content": "In vitro fertilization (IVF) encompasses several options depending on individual circumstances and needs. Here are three common IVF options:\n\n1. **Standard IVF**: This typical IVF process involves ovarian stimulation with medication to produce multiple eggs, which are then retrieved, fertilized with sperm in the lab, and the resulting embryos are developed for transfer back into the uterus.\n\n2. **ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection)**: ICSI is often used in cases of male infertility. In this procedure, a single sperm is injected directly into an egg to facilitate fertilization. This method can be particularly helpful when there are issues with sperm quality or quantity.\n\n3. **Donor Egg or Sperm IVF**: If there are concerns about egg or sperm quality, using donor eggs or sperm is an option. This allows individuals or couples to use gametes from a donor, which can enhance the chances of conception when traditional IVF may not be successful.\n\nEach option may have different implications and success rates depending on individual circumstances. It's important to discuss these options with your fertility specialist to determine the best approach for your situation. If you have more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
